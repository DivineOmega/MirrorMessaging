MirrorMessaging
===============

Mirror Messaging is a user-friendly HTML/CSS interface for Bitmessage. The idea behind Mirror Messaging is to provide all the benfits of Bitmessage (encryption, peer-to-peer, etc.) behind a familiar webmail style interface.

It is a Java application which consists of:

* A locally bound custom web server
* HTML/CSS templates
* A layer to communicate with Bitmessage via its API
